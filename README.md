# LazyEmacsConfig
Here is my emacs configuration.
If you want to use it, just put both files in your .emacs.d folder. You'll need to install some packages, so remember to add MELPA to your package list.

I recommend just getting snippets from my settings.org (I keep most of my configs in there).

If you'll like to keep your configs organised, I highly recommend putting it in an org-mode file.

Disclaimer: most of those configs are from 
dot-emacs (https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs), 
https://github.com/bixuanzju/emacs.d/blob/master/emacs-init.org
and some fixes I got from stack exchange.
